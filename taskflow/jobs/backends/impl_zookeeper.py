class ZookeeperJobBoard(base.NotifyingJobBoard):
    """A jobboard backed by `zookeeper`_.

    Powered by the `kazoo <https://kazoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library.

    This jobboard creates *sequenced* persistent znodes in a directory in
    zookeeper and uses zookeeper watches to notify other jobboards of
    jobs which were posted using the :meth:`.post` method (this creates a
    znode with job contents/details encoded in `json`_). The users of these
    jobboard(s) (potentially on disjoint sets of machines) can then iterate
    over the available jobs and decide if they want
    to attempt to claim one of the jobs they have iterated over. If so they
    will then attempt to contact zookeeper and they will attempt to create a
    ephemeral znode using the name of the persistent znode + ".lock" as a
    postfix. If the entity trying to use the jobboard to :meth:`.claim` the
    job is able to create a ephemeral znode with that name then it will be
    allowed (and expected) to perform whatever *work* the contents of that
    job described. Once the claiming entity is finished the ephemeral znode
    and persistent znode will be deleted (if successfully completed) in a
    single transaction. If the claiming entity is not successful (or the
    entity that claimed the znode dies) the ephemeral znode will be
    released (either manually by using :meth:`.abandon` or automatically by
    zookeeper when the ephemeral node and associated session is deemed to
    have been lost).

    Do note that the creation of a kazoo client is achieved
    by :py:func:`~taskflow.utils.kazoo_utils.make_client` and the transfer
    of this jobboard configuration to that function to make a
    client may happen at ``__init__`` time. This implies that certain
    parameters from this jobboard configuration may be provided to
    :py:func:`~taskflow.utils.kazoo_utils.make_client` such
    that if a client was not provided by the caller one will be created
    according to :py:func:`~taskflow.utils.kazoo_utils.make_client`'s
    specification
