    This conductor iterates over jobs in the provided jobboard (waiting for
    the given timeout if no jobs exist) and attempts to claim them, work on
    those jobs using an executor (potentially blocking further work from being
    claimed and consumed) and then consume those work units after
    completion. This process will repeat until the conductor has been stopped
    or other critical error occurs.

    NOTE(harlowja): consumption occurs even if a engine fails to run due to
    a atom failure. This is only skipped when an execution failure or
    a storage failure occurs which are *usually* correctable by re-running on
    a different conductor (storage failures and execution failures may be
    transient issues that can be worked around by later execution). If a job
    after completing can not be consumed or abandoned the conductor relies
    upon the jobboard capabilities to automatically abandon these jobs.
